<h2>1. What are some of the best practices for creating effective wire-frames in computer science? How do wire-frames help with the design process?</h2>
<p>Define the goals and user needs: Before starting the wireframe, it's essential to define the goals of the project and the needs of the target audience. This will help to create a wireframe that meets the expectations and requirements of the users.
Keep it simple: Wireframes should be simple and easy to understand. Avoid adding too many details or elements that could clutter the design and confuse the users. Wireframes help with the design process by providing a visual representation of the layout and functionality of a digital product. They allow designers to test and refine their ideas before moving on to the final design. </p>

<h2>2. How does user testing play a role in the design of user interfaces and wire-frames in computer science? Can you provide an example of a project where user testing significantly impacted the final product design?</h2>
<p>User testing plays a crucial role in the design of user interfaces and wireframes in computer science. It allows designers to gather feedback from real users and identify potential problems with the design. User testing can be conducted at various stages of the design process, including during the wireframing phase. By testing wireframes with users, designers can get feedback on the layout, functionality, and usability of the design before moving on to the final design and development phases.

An example of a project where user testing significantly impacted the final product design is the redesign of the website for the New York Philharmonic. The design team created wireframes for the new website and conducted user testing to get feedback on the design. Based on the feedback, they made several significant changes to the wireframes, including simplifying the navigation, improving the search functionality, and adding more prominent calls to action. These changes resulted in a more user-friendly design that improved the overall user experience of the website.</p>

<h2>1. What is Bootstrap and how is it useful n developing websites?</h2>
<p>Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework that provides a set of tools and pre-built components for web development. It includes CSS, JavaScript, and HTML templates that make it easy to create responsive and mobile-first websites. Bootstrap also offers a grid system, which allows developers to create flexible and customizable layouts. By using Bootstrap, developers can save time and improve their workflow by leveraging pre-built components and responsive design features. It's also easy to customize and extend Bootstrap to meet the specific needs of a project. Overall, Bootstrap is a useful tool for web development that can help developers create high-quality websites quickly and efficiently.</p>
<h2>2. What are the benefits of using Bootstrap in web development compared to css?</h2>
<p>Bootstrap is a front-end framework that is built on top of CSS. While CSS provides basic styling capabilities for web development, Bootstrap offers many additional features and benefits that make it a powerful tool for building websites. Here are some benefits of using Bootstrap in web development compared to CSS:

Pre-built components: Bootstrap provides a library of pre-built components, such as buttons, forms, and navigation bars, that can be easily customized and used in a project. This saves developers time and effort by allowing them to leverage existing components rather than building them from scratch.

Responsive design: Bootstrap is designed to be responsive, meaning that it automatically adjusts the layout and styling of a website based on the device it is being viewed on. This ensures that the website looks and functions well on a range of devices, from desktops to smartphones.</p>
<h2>3. How can you include Bootstrap in YOUR website development?</h2>
<p>To include Bootstrap in your website development, you can follow these steps:

Download Bootstrap: You can download the latest version of Bootstrap from the official website at https://getbootstrap.com/. Bootstrap is available in two formats: a compiled version, which includes CSS and JavaScript files, and a source code version, which requires compilation using a tool like Node.js or Sass.

Include Bootstrap files in your HTML document: Once you have downloaded Bootstrap, you need to include the necessary CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML document. </p>
<h2>4. What do selectors do? Explain one selector in your own words.</h2>
<p>In Python, selectors are used to monitor and respond to events that occur on input/output (I/O) resources, such as network sockets, pipes, and files. Selectors allow a program to wait for one or more I/O resources to become available for reading or writing, without having to block the program's execution.

One selector in Python is the selectors.DefaultSelector() class, which creates a new selector object that can be used to monitor I/O resources. This selector class provides a method called register(), which is used to register a new I/O resource with the selector.</p>

<h2>1. What are examples of selection, iteration, and sequencing in the snake game?</h2>
<p>    Selection: The game code includes several instances of conditional statements, which are used to select between different paths of execution based on certain conditions. For example, in the update function, there is a conditional statement that checks if the snake has collided with the food: if self.head == self.food_pos:. If this condition is true, then the snake has eaten the food and the game needs to update the score and generate a new piece of food.

Iteration: The game code also includes several loops, which are used to repeat certain actions a specified number of times or until a certain condition is met. For example, in the update function, there is a loop that iterates through all of the snake's body segments and updates their positions based on the position of the segment in front of them: for i in range(len(self.body)-1, 0, -1):. This loop is used to update the positions of all the body segments except for the head, which is handled separately.

Sequencing: Finally, the game code includes several sequences of instructions that are executed in a specific order to achieve a particular goal. For example, in the update function, the code first checks for collisions, then updates the snake's position, then checks if the snake has collided with the walls or with itself, and finally updates.</p>
<h2>2. How does ":root" contribute to the customization of the game?</h2>
<p>The :root selector in CSS refers to the root element of the document, which is usually the html element. It is used to define global CSS variables that can be accessed throughout the entire document, allowing for easy customization of various elements in the game.

In the snake game code provided, the :root selector is used to define several CSS variables, such as --grid-size, --snake-color, and --food-color. These variables are then used in other CSS rules to set the size of the game grid, the color of the snake and food, and other visual aspects of the game.

By using CSS variables, the game can be easily customized by changing the values of these variables in the :root selector. For example, if you want to make the game grid larger, you can simply change the value of --grid-size in the :root selector, and all the elements that use that variable will be updated accordingly. This makes it much easier to customize the game's appearance and behavior without having to go through and modify each individual CSS rule.</p>
<h2>3. Write 2-3 sentences about how the use of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS creates the final product.</h2>
<p>The combination of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS is essential in creating dynamic and interactive web-based applications like the Snake Game. HTML provides the structure and content of the game, JavaScript adds the interactivity and logic to the game, while CSS controls the presentation and visual styling of the game. Together, these three technologies work seamlessly to create a cohesive and engaging user experience.</p>
